# Instagram Reach Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Project Overview

This project explores Instagram reach and engagement metrics using exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset contains various features such as impressions, likes, comments, shares, saves, and other engagement metrics. The objective is to identify key insights, correlations, and trends that affect content reach and engagement.

# Dataset Information

Columns:

Impressions - Total number of views on the post

From Home - Impressions from the home feed

From Hashtags - Impressions from hashtags

From Explore - Impressions from the Explore page

From Other - Impressions from other sources

Saves - Number of times the post was saved

Comments - Number of comments on the post

Shares - Number of times the post was shared

Likes - Number of likes on the post

Profile Visits - Number of profile visits generated by the post

Follows - Number of new followers gained from the post

Caption - Text content of the post

Hashtags - Hashtags used in the post

# Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing values (No missing values found).

Verified data types (Numeric and text-based columns identified).

Generated summary statistics to understand distribution and variance.

Normalized and scaled engagement metrics for improved comparability.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Correlation Analysis

A heatmap was used to visualize correlations between numerical features.

Key findings:

From Explore and Follows had the highest correlation with Impressions.

Likes, Saves, and Profile Visits also showed strong correlations with Impressions.

Comments had a very weak correlation with Impressions.

2. Relationship Between Impressions and Engagement Metrics

Scatter plots with trend lines were generated for:

Impressions vs. Likes

Impressions vs. Comments

Impressions vs. Shares

Impressions vs. Saves

3. Source-wise Analysis of Impressions

A pie chart was created to show the proportion of impressions from different sources:

From Home contributed the most impressions.

From Explore had a significant impact on reach.

From Hashtags played an important role in engagement.

A bar chart was used to compare total impressions from each source.

4. Hashtag & Caption Analysis

A word cloud was generated for hashtags to identify the most frequently used keywords.

Another word cloud was created for captions to observe the common terms in post descriptions.

Performed TF-IDF analysis on captions to determine the most important words influencing engagement.

5. Time-Series Analysis

Analyzed posting times and their effect on impressions and engagement.

Created a heatmap to visualize engagement trends by day of the week and hour of posting.

Identified optimal posting times for maximizing reach.

# Key Insights

Posts that gained high impressions from Explore had a higher chance of increasing Follows.

Likes, Saves, and Shares were positively correlated with Impressions, suggesting that engaging content boosts reach.

Hashtags played a role in reach, but Home Feed and Explore remained dominant sources of impressions.

Caption analysis showed trends in frequently used words, which may indicate popular topics among followers.

Posting at specific peak hours significantly increased engagement.

# Tools & Libraries Used

pandas - Data manipulation

numpy - Numerical computations

matplotlib & seaborn - Data visualization

plotly - Interactive charts

wordcloud - Text data visualization

scikit-learn - Model building (Passive Aggressive Regressor for trend analysis)

NLTK & TF-IDF - Text processing for captions and hashtags

# Conclusion

The Instagram reach analysis provides insights into how different engagement metrics influence impressions and follower growth. Content creators can optimize their strategies by focusing on posts that gain more visibility from Explore and Home feeds while using relevant hashtags and engaging captions. Additionally, optimizing posting times can significantly impact engagement rates.

# Future Work

Implement machine learning models to predict post reach based on engagement metrics.

Optimize hashtag usage to maximize impressions.

Perform sentiment analysis on captions to explore how emotions impact engagement.

Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time reach analysis.
